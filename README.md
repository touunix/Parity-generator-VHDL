# ENG Parity generator VHDL
The circuit serves as a parity generator. Based on the entered 8-bit word, it displays information on a seven-segment display on the FPGA board, with an even or odd number of "ones" in the input word.
In a situation when the entered word contains an even number of "ones", the system signals it on the seven-segment display with the displayed letter "E".
In a situation when the entered word contains an odd number of "ones", the system signals it on the seven-segment display with the displayed letter "O".
